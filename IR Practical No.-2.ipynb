    "# That's great you're preparing for your practical exam! Yes, I **do understand** the provided Python code. \n",
    "# It successfully implements a **document retrieval program using an inverted file (or inverted index)**, \n",
    "# which is a fundamental concept in Information Retrieval (IR).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here is an explanation of the code, designed to prepare you for potential questions in your practical exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 💡 Information Retrieval (IR) Practical Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "# The goal of the code is to efficiently find which documents contain a specific search term. It does this by building and using an **Inverted Index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 1. The Document Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "# The code starts with the document collection, which is a list of strings (Code Cell 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "# * **Code:** `documents = [...]`\n",
    "# * **Concept:** This is the **corpus** or the set of documents that the search system indexes and queries against. \n",
    "# In this example, there are four documents (indexed 0 to 3).\n",
    "#     * Doc 0: \"Information retrieval is the process...\"\n",
    "#     * Doc 1: \"Inverted file is an index structure...\"\n",
    "#     * ...and so on.\n",
    "# * **Potential Questions:**\n",
    "#     * *What is this list?* It's the collection of documents (the corpus) we are indexing.\n",
    "#     * *How many documents are there?* Four, indexed from 0 to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 2. Initializing the Inverted Index\n",
    "\n",
    "# A dictionary is initialized to store the index (Code Cell 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "# * **Code:** `inverted_index = {}`\n",
    "# * **Concept:** This dictionary is the core of the inverted file.\n",
    "#     * **Key:** A **term** (a unique word from the documents).\n",
    "#     * **Value:** A **posting list**, which is a list of the **document IDs** where that term appears.\n",
    "# * **Potential Questions:**\n",
    "#     * *What data structure did you use for the inverted index?* A Python **dictionary** (hash map/table).\n",
    "#     * *Why a dictionary?* Dictionaries provide **fast (average O(1)) lookups** of the words (keys), which is crucial for quick searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 3. Building the Inverted Index (The Indexing Process)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is the main logic where the index is constructed (Code Cell 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "# | Line of Code | Explanation |\n",
    "# | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "# | `for doc_id, text in enumerate(documents):` | Iterates through the document list, getting both the **index** (the `doc_id`: 0, 1, 2, 3) \n",
    "# and the document **text**. |\n",
    "# | `for word in text.lower().split():` | **Tokenization:** Splits the text into individual words, and converts everything to **lowercase** \n",
    "# for consistency (case-folding). |\n",
    "# | `word = word.strip('.,')` | **Text Normalization:** Removes punctuation (like '.', ',') from the beginning and end of the word so, for example, \n",
    "# \"collection.\" and \"collection\" are treated as the same term. |\n",
    "# | `if word not in inverted_index: ...` | If the word is encountered for the first time, it creates a new entry (key) in the dictionary \n",
    "# with an empty list (`[]`) as its posting list (value). |\n",
    "# | `if doc_id not in inverted_index[word]: ...` | **Crucial Step:** Checks if the current document ID is *already* in the word's posting list. |\n",
    "# | `inverted_index[word].append(doc_id)` | If the `doc_id` is new, it is added to the posting list. \n",
    "# This ensures each document ID appears **only once** per term, regardless of how many times the term appears in that document. |\n",
    "\n",
    "# * **Potential Questions:**\n",
    "#     * *What is **tokenization**?* It is the process of breaking a stream of text into meaningful units, called tokens (words). \n",
    "#     Here, `split()` is used.\n",
    "#     * *Why do you use `.lower()` and `.strip()`?* To perform **text normalization** (or pre-processing). \n",
    "#     Lowercasing ensures case-insensitivity (\"The\" and \"the\" are the same term). Stripping punctuation handles common symbols.\n",
    "#     * *Why the `if doc_id not in inverted_index[word]:` check?* To ensure the index is a **Boolean Inverted Index**, \n",
    "#     where the posting list only contains unique document IDs. If we were building a **Ranked Retrieval** index, \n",
    "#     we might record the term frequency instead.\n",
    "#     * *Show an example of an entry in the index.* The term **`inverted`** is in documents 1, 2, and 3, so its entry is: `inverted -> [1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 4. Displaying the Inverted Index\n",
    "\n",
    "# This part (Code Cell 4) simply prints the generated index in a sorted, readable format. It's for visualization and verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "# * **Concept:** The output confirms that for every unique word, you have a list of document IDs where it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 5. Document Retrieval (The Query Process)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This section handles a user query and returns the matching documents (Code Cell 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "# | Line of Code | Explanation |\n",
    "# | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "# | `query = input(...).lower()` | Takes user input and converts it to lowercase, mirroring the normalization done during index building. |\n",
    "# | `if query in inverted_index:` | **The main search step:** Directly looks up the search term in the inverted index dictionary. This is **very fast**. |\n",
    "# | `for doc_id in inverted_index[query]:` | Iterates through the posting list (the document IDs) associated with the query term. |\n",
    "# | `print(f\"Doc {doc_id+1}: {documents[doc_id]}\")` | Retrieves and prints the original document text using the stored `doc_id`. \n",
    "# Note that it adds **`+1`** for user readability (displaying Doc 1, Doc 2, etc., instead of Doc 0, Doc 1, etc.). |\n",
    "\n",
    "# * **Potential Questions:**\n",
    "#     * *How does the inverted index speed up retrieval?* Instead of scanning every word in every document (a full-text scan) \n",
    "#     for the query term, we only perform a **single, fast dictionary lookup** to get the list of relevant document IDs.\n",
    "#     * *What is the time complexity difference between using an index and not using one?* Without an index, search time is roughly proportional \n",
    "#     to the total size of the corpus ($\\mathbf{O(N)}$, where $N$ is total text length). With an index, it's a very fast lookup ($\\mathbf{O(1)}$ average) \n",
    "#     followed by reading the posting list ($\\mathbf{O(L)}$, where $L$ is posting list length), making it vastly faster for large collections.\n",
    "#     * *What happens if the term isn't found?* The `else` block executes, printing \"Term not found in any document.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## 🚀 Key Takeaways for the Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.  **Definition:** An **Inverted Index** maps terms to the documents they appear in.\n",
    "# 2.  **Implementation:** The index is implemented as a **dictionary** in Python, where keys are terms and values are lists of document IDs.\n",
    "# 3.  **Indexing Steps:** The core steps are **Tokenization**, **Normalization** (lowercasing, punctuation removal), and building the \n",
    "# **Posting List** (ensuring unique document IDs per term).\n",
    "# 4.  **Retrieval Efficiency:** The inverted index allows for **instantaneous lookup** of the relevant document IDs, \n",
    "# avoiding slow linear scans of the entire document set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# I can guide you through a step-by-step trace of how a specific term, like \"**information**,\" is indexed or retrieved, if that would be helpful!"
