    "# **1 classical bit** for the final measurement result. |\n",

    "# #### Exam Questions & Suggested Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "# | Question | Suggested Answer (Be concise and confident) |\n",
    "# | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "# | **What is the purpose of this practical?** | To demonstrate a basic **Quantum Error Correction (QEC)** scheme, specifically the \n",
    "# **three-qubit Bit-Flip Code**, to protect a quantum state from a single bit-flip error. |\n",
    "# | **What is the logical state you are protecting?** | We are protecting the state $|1\\rangle$. \n",
    "# It's encoded into the logical state $|1_L\\rangle = |111\\rangle$. |\n",
    "# | **What gates are used for encoding?** | Two **CNOT** gates are used: `CX(0, 1)` and `CX(0, 2)`. \n",
    "#     They prepare the entangled state $|111\\rangle$ from the initial data qubit $|1\\rangle$. |\n",
    "# | **How do you simulate noise/error?** | Noise is simulated by applying a single **$X$ (NOT) gate** \n",
    "#     to a randomly chosen qubit (`error_qubit`). This simulates a **bit-flip error**. |\n",
    "# | **What gate is central to the correction?** | The **Toffoli gate (CCX)**, along with CNOTs, is used. \n",
    "#     It effectively performs a \"majority vote\" to correct the state of the data qubit (qubit 0). |\n",
    "# | **Why did the measurement result in '1'?** | The initial state was $|1\\rangle$, and despite the single bit-flip error, \n",
    "# the **error correction circuit successfully recovered** the original state, which we then measured back as **1**. |\n",
    "# | **Can this code correct two bit-flip errors?** | **No**. This code is a **minimum redundancy code** and can only correct **one** error. \n",
    "# Two errors (e.g., $|001\\rangle$) would be interpreted as the state $|0_L\\rangle$ with one error, leading to a failure in correction. |\n"
